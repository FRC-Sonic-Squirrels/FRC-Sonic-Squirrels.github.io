<p>The Sonic Squirrels 2930 are pleased to share their solution to threading ties into pleated and/or shaped fabric masks. These 3D <span class="il">needles</span> work with many sizes of elastic, cording, knit T shirt ties, bias tape, and woven fabric ties. The <span class="il">needles</span> also make it easy to "thread" many masks at once if you are producing in bulk. We give them away in pairs. The <span class="il">needles</span> are approximately 5 and 5.5 inches in length. Each <span class="il">needle</span> takes about 10-12 minutes to print on an Ultimaker 2+ in PLA+ filament. Times and results will vary depending on settings. We tried printing multiple <span class="il">needles</span> at once, but found trailing filaments to be a problem.</p>
