<p>
We're headed to the PNW District Championships in Cheney, WA April 6 - 9! This season's students (over half rookies who
had never touched a robot) have come together and built an amazing organization and machine. Their success so far has us
not only planning for the PNW Championship but suddenly we are preparing to attend the FIRST Robotics World Championship
in Houston. Only 18 teams from the PNW will be invited to Worlds and we like our chances. We're looking forward to
representing Glacier Peak and Snohomish High Schools with enthusiasm and gracious professionalism.
<p>
