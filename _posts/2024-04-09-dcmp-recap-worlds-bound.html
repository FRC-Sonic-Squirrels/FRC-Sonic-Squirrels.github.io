<p>
  Last weekend, The Sonic Squirrels competed at the Pacific Northwest Championship, 
  earning 105 district points and the Autonomous Award for our outstanding programming.  
</p>
<p>
  The district points we earned at this last competition as well as our past two district 
  events have qualified us to go to the World Championship in Houston, TX. 
</p>
<p>
  We can't wait to see everyone there!!
