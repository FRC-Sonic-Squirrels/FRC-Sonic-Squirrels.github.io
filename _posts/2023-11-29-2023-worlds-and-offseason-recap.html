We became 1 of 8 winners for <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2023/team/2930">the Autonomous Award at the FIRST Robotics
World Championships in 2023</a> (Awards tab in the link)! 
3,286 teams competed at FIRST Robotics in 2023. We ranked <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2023/HCMP/rankings">13 out of 77 
in 1 of 8 division</a> at the Worlds. Would you like to see our robot
in action at the Worlds?  <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2023/HCMP/qualifications/119">It is the 2930 of the blue alliance in this 3-minute video.</a>
</p>
<p>
We <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2023wagg#rankings">ranked 1 of 32 at the 2023 WA Girls Generation</a> competition 
and won the final!
</p>
<p>
Our team 2930's alliance won at the off-season <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2023wamc#rankings">2023 PNW 
(Pacific Northwest) Block Party on 10/29/2023!</a> Additionally, 
we were the only club that <a href="https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2023/WAMil/playoffs">both main team (2930) and sub team 
(9999) went to the final</a>. It is amazing, considering Team 9999 
robot was designed for and went through the 2022 World Championship.
