We competed in the PNW District Championships in Cheney, WA on April 5-8, 2023. Our team finished the qualifying matches ranked 16 with a record of 7-5. We were honored to be selected as the first pick by the #3 Alliance captain, team 1318 Issaquah Robotics Society (IRS), and were also joined by team 5920 Vikoticks, and team 1899 Saints Robotics on our Alliance.

Our team also won the Autonomous Award for the third time this year! Full results are available on <a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2023pncmp">The Blue Alliance</a> website.

We finished the season ranked 4th overall in the PNW District and are thrilled to qualify for the FIRST Robotics World Championship in Houston, TX. We are looking forward to representing Glacier Peak High School and Snohomish High School with enthusiasm and gracious professionalism.

A huge thanks to our sponsors, parents, mentors, fans, and everyone else for making this possible! We will see you at the World Championships in Houston!
