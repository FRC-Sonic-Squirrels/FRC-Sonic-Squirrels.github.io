Week 1: The Sonic Squirrels hosted an event at Glacier Peak High School. Hosting an event is always an honor - but it can be frantic! Squirrels spent the day scurrying about assisting in field construction and pit organization and helping each team have the most convenient experience possible. We pride ourselves on fostering a positive environment within FIRST, and what better way than by hosting an amazing competition?
</p>
<p>
Our team finished the qualifying rounds ranked 2nd with a record of 11-1-0 and went on to win the event and the Autonomous Award. We were honored to be selected as the first pick by the #1 Alliance captain, team 2910 Jack in the Bot, and were also joined by team 1778 Chill Out on our Alliance.

Week 3: The Sonic Squirrels spent a weekend at Bonney Lake, participating in our second season competition. Bonney Lake High School was a novel experience for the entire team, as we have never competed at that event. This provided a brand-new opportunity to meet many wonderful teams that we've never had the chance to interact with. Having the opportunity to expand our team's connections and sources of inspiration was highly rewarding, and we look forward to further interactions with a larger group of teams.
</p>
<p>
Our team finished the qualifying rounds ranked 1st with a record of 9-3-0, won our second Autonomous Award of the season, and were the Captain of the #1 Alliance. We finished the event as District Event Finalist with a playoff record of 4-3. A huge thank you to our alliance partners team 2046 Bear Metal, team 4681 Murphy's Law, and team 8896 Wolf Tech Robotics.

A huge thanks to our sponsors, parents, mentors, fans, and everyone else for making these events possible! Another huge thank you to our alliance partners team 2910 Jack in the Bot, team 1778 Chill Out, 2046 Bear Metal, team 4681 Murphy's Law, and team 8896 Wolf Tech Robotics. We will see you at the PNW District Championships!
