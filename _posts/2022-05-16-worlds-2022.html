    After three competitions this year, we made it to the 2022 First Robotics World Championships! We placed 54th place in the Newton division and averaged 94 points a match and 23.6 
    points for the hanger. Despite all the obstacleswe encountered such as our shooter being broken, battery issues, and more - we persevered and overcame these challenges in the end.
    We all had a blast at the competition!
