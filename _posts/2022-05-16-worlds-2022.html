<p>
After three competitions this year, we made it to the 2022 First Robotics World 
Championships! 
</p>
<p>
We placed 54th place in the Newton division and averaged 94 points a match and 23.6 
points for the hanger. Despite all the obstacles we encountered such as our shooter 
breaking before a match, battery issues, and more. We persevered and overcame these 
challenges and finished strong in our last couple qualifying matches.
</p>
<p>
We all had a blast at the competition! Everyone came back energized and full of ideas 
for next season.
