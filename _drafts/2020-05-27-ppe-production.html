<p>In light of the coronavirus, the Sonic Squirrels are supporting a local volunteer group in 3D printing parts for NIH-approved personal protective equipment (PPE) for fire, hospitals, airlift companies, and more. The printed parts can be sterilized and reused. The organizers of the group have the clear sheets already and they sterilize the PPE parts that you donate. Anyone in the local area can join their printing campaign by joining their Facebook group.</p>
<p>If you are a Squirrel Family and wish to join this effort, please contact Susan Dole at susan.dole@gmail.com. She will help keep track of your filament use for reimbursement and coordinate pickup of what you print.</p>
<p><strong>3D PRINTING FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Facebook Group Name is “North Seattle/South Snohomish COVID-19 PPE builders group”. Collection and distribution of printed items and medical equipment is local.</p>
