<h4 style="text-align: center;">Do you want to sponsor the Sonic Squirrels?</h4>
<p>
We are the Sonic Squirrels, a FIRST Robotics team from Snohomish, WA. We would love to have your support for our STEM program! We are about to compete with 600 of the best teams in the world on April 19th-22nd at the World Championship in Houston, Texas. You are investing in your local community, students, and families. You may also be investing in your future employees - several local companies recruit directly through our team's connections - our students graduate high school trained, motivated, and know how to work hard.
