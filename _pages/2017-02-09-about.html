<p>The Sonic Squirrels 2930 robotics team is part of <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST Robotics</a>, which
  combines the excitement of competitive sports with the tremendous opportunities to develop STEM skills under the
  guidance of professional engineering and business volunteer mentors. Our team fosters well-rounded life capabilities
  including self-confidence, communication, and leadership. Students on our team learn and apply vital workforce skills,
  including, engineering, programming, computer-aided drafting and design, marketing , graphic design, website
  development, business planning, and fundraising skills. Our team designs and builds robots based on an annually themed
  challenge under strict rules, limited resources, and tight time constraints. In the off season, we spend time in the
  community working with others at STEM related events.</p>
