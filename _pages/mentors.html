<p>Mentors are an integral part of our team. They teach us new things and guide us in the process of building a robot. Anyone can mentor a FIRST team, for example, our mentors come from many different backgrounds and walks of life.</p>

<p> Melanie got involved 2015 driving and feeding Squirrels as a parent, then a little more involved in 2016 helping mentor some of the "non-engineering" aspects of the team. Her son graduated but she stayed with the team as the operations&nbsp;mentor. She coaches the Business, Media, Spirit, Outreach, and Scouting sub teams as well as assistant&nbsp;Mr. Wilson with team logistics.&nbsp; When not Squirreling around, she works full time as a Practice Manager at Redmond Eye Doctors. In her rare time off, she likes to be outside - preferably&nbsp;near a beach or castle but her backyard hammock is nice too. </p>

<p>John Ireton is Kaitlyn Morgan's father, and this is his first year. In the real world, he is a mobile software developer working on iPhone apps for Fortune-500 companies, so naturally he is mentoring on the Programming team. Many years ago, he used to play Magic: the Gathering competitively and was a certified judge. He also takes care of a small herd of backyard goats, chickens and one noisy duck.</p>
