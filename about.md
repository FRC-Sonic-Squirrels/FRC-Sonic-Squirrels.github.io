 The Sonic Squirrels 2930 robotics team is part of [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/), which combines the excitement of competitive sports with the tremendous opportunities to develop STEM skills under the guidance of professional engineering and business volunteer mentors. Our team fosters well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership. Students on our team learn and apply vital workforce skills, including, engineering, programming, computer-aided drafting and design, marketing , graphic design, website development, business planning, and fundraising skills. Our team designs and builds robots based on an annually themed challenge under strict rules, limited resources, and tight time constraints. In the off season, we spend time in the community working with others at STEM related events.
